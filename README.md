# Milling Tool Forces

This code is based on the milling tool force model described in the paper:
T. A. Dow, E. L. Miller, and K. Garrard, "Tool force and deflection compensation for small milling tools," Precision Engineering, vol. 28, no. 1, pp. 31â€“45, Jan. 2004.

A plot of milling forces in three directions as a function of tool rotation angle can be obtained. An example plot is shown below. The magnitude of these forces aids in sizing the spindle bearings.

TODO: [Aug 16 2025]   Extend the code to include tool deflection.
